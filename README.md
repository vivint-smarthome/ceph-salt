Deploy Ceph cluster with SaltStack
=========

Salt states for Ceph cluster deployment. Currently only Ceph MONs and OSDs are supported.

Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 with Ceph Firefly release.

Test environment with Vagrant
==============

If you want to test this deployment on your local machine inside VMs, the easiest way is to use Vagrant with VirtualBox provider. All you need is to go inside vagrant directory and run:
```
cd vagrant && vagrant up
```
This will bring up 3 VMs, one master and 3 minion nodes. Ceph will be deployed on two minion nodes. Also those VMs will have two additional network interfaces to emulate public and cluster network for Ceph and two additional HDDs attached to them. One will be used for OSD and one for journal. Environment description is located here: ```pillar/environment.sls```

Test the connectivity between master and minions:
```
vagrant ssh master
sudo salt '*' test.ping
``` 
If everything is OK you can proceed with Ceph deployment step: https://github.com/komljen/ceph-salt#deployment

Prepare your environment
==============

First you need Salt master and minions installed and running on all nodes and minions keys should be accepted.

Master node
--------------

On the master node you need to include additional options. Add ```vagrant/configs/master``` file to ```/etc/salt/master.d/``` directory.

New options will make sure that minions can send files to the master and other minions to be able to get those files. Salt master restart is required:
```
service salt-master restart
```
Salt states and pillars
--------------

Clone this git repository:
```
rm -rf /srv/salt /srv/pillar
cd /srv && git clone https://github.com/komljen/ceph-salt.git .
```
Configuration options
--------------

Environment description file with examples is located here: ```pillar/environment.sls```. Edit this file to match with your environment:
```
ceph:
  nodes:
    master:
      roles:
        - ceph-mon
    node01:
      roles:
        - ceph-osd
        - ceph-mon
      devs:
        sdc:
          journal: sdb
        sdd:
          journal: sdb
    node02:
      roles:
        - ceph-osd
        - ceph-mon
      devs:
        sdc:
          journal: sdb
        sdd:
          journal: sdb
```
Ceph configuration file will be automatically generated. Edit ```pillar/data/ceph.sls``` if you want to make additional changes:
```
ceph:
  version: firefly
  cluster_name: ceph
  global:
    cluster_network: 192.168.36.0/24
    fsid: 294bc494-81ba-4c3c-ac5d-af7b3442a2a5
    public_network: 192.168.33.0/24
  client:
    rbd_cache: "true"
    rbd_cache_writethrough_until_flash: "true"
    rbd_cache_size: 134217728
  osd:
    crush_chooseleaf_type: 1
    crush_update_on_start: "true"
    filestore_merge_threshold: 10
    filestore_split_multiple: 2
    filestore_op_threads: 2
    filestore_max_sync_interval: 5
    filestore_min_sync_interval: "0.01"
    filestore_queue_max_ops: 500
    filestore_queue_max_bytes: 104857600
    filestore_queue_committing_max_ops: 500
    filestore_queue_committing_max_bytes: 104857600
    journal_size: 512
    op_threads: 1
    disk_threads: 1
    scrub_load_threshold: "0.5"
    map_cache_size: 512
    max_backfills: 2
    pool_default_min_size: 1
    pool_default_pg_num: 128
    pool_default_pgp_num: 128
    pool_default_size: 3
  mon:
    interface: eth1
```
Take a look at those options to match with your machines:
```
public_network: 192.168.33.0/24
cluster_network: 192.168.36.0/24
interface: eth1
```
Proceed with deployment step after changes are done.

Deployment
==============

First you need to run highstate to add roles to minions based on environment.sls file:
```
salt '*' state.highstate
```
To start Ceph cluster deployment run orchestrate state from Salt master:
```
salt-run -l debug state.orchestrate orchestrate.ceph
``` 
It will take few minutes to complete. Then you can check ceph cluster status from master:
```
salt 'node01' cmd.run 'ceph -s'
```
